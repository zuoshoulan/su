 Request to Read data from the {@link Channel} into the first inbound buffer, triggers an {@link ChannelInboundHandler#channelRead(ChannelHandlerContext, Object)} event if data was read, and triggers a {@link ChannelInboundHandler#channelReadComplete(ChannelHandlerContext) channelReadComplete} event so the handler can decide to continue reading.  If there's a pending read operation already, this method does nothing. <p> This will result in having the {@link ChannelOutboundHandler#read(ChannelHandlerContext)} method called of the next {@link ChannelOutboundHandler} contained in the {@link ChannelPipeline} of the {@link Channel}.
