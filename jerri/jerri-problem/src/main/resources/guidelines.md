In this part of the interview process, we'd like you to come up with an algorithm to
solve the problem as described below. The problem itself is quite simple to solve.
What we are mainly looking for in this test (other than that the solution should work)
is, how well you actually write the code. We want to see how you write productionquality code in a team setting where multiple developers will be collaborating on the
codebase.
Specifically, we are looking for: simple, clean, readable and maintainable code, for
example:
Code organization and submission format. Things like code organization,
readability, documentation, testing and deliverability are most important here.
Your mastery of idiomatic programming.
The solution is prefered to be in JavaScript. We understand that you may not have much
experience with JS. We encourage you to take some time to research modern JS and best
practices, and try your best to apply them when writing your test solution.
If you choose to use a programming language other than JS, please still make sure you
stick to the idiomatic way of that programming language.
